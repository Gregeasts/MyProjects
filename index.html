      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I am Greg Eastman, a university student at Plymouth studying mathematics and computer science. As a youth player, I played within Argyle's youth setup from U10 - U16 ages before being released and becoming a coach within Cornwall's COE and Elite Hub setups. Currently, I am also Youth Male and Boys Lead for Cornwall FA. Welcome to my personal space where I share my passion for web development, app creation, and football analysis. I’ve created a variety of projects that range from educational tools and e-commerce applications to insightful football maps. Each project represents my journey of learning, problem-solving, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with technology. Explore my work and get in touch if you have any questions or would like to collaborate!</p>

        <h3>Complete Cornwall Football Map</h3>
        <p>As A follow up project leading on from the Footballing Demographic Report in Cornwall on the youth male set up in Cornwall, I completed another piece of work mapping the entire football demographic across Cornwall for all of the youth, adult, veteran, male, female and disabled teams in Cornwall. The teams shown can be filtered by multiple characteristics and also show the areas suffering from a lack of teams, much alike my previous project. </p>
