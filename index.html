      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I am Greg Eastman, a university student at Plymouth studying mathematics and computer science. As a youth player, I played within Argyle's youth setup from U10 - U16 ages before being released and becoming a coach within Cornwall's COE and Elite Hub setups. Currently, I am also Youth Male and Boys Lead for Cornwall FA. Welcome to my personal space where I share my passion for web development, app creation, and football analysis. I’ve created a variety of projects that range from educational tools and e-commerce applications to insightful football maps. Each project represents my journey of learning, problem-solving, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with technology. Explore my work and get in touch if you have any questions or would like to collaborate!</p>
